DominateJS
==========

A heavily modified (and powerful!) evolution of ControlJS, by Steve Souders (original project at [http://code.google.com/p/controljs/](http://code.google.com/p/controljs/ "ControlJS Google Code Project Page")).

DominateJS allows you to asynchronously load all your JavaScript, and defer sequential execution until the page loads. DominateJS aims to be a cross-browser, small and document.write safe library!
